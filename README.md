# Self-Motive4Tech
Self-motivation is the force that keeps pushing us to go on – it's our internal drive to achieve, produce, develop, and keep moving forward. When you think you're ready to quit something, or you just don't know how to start, your self-motivation is what pushes you to go on. This repository project will let you identify yourself, and guide you through.

**Self-Motive4Tech** is a project intended to lay down a guide that serves to motivate any person, community or even an organisation with a goal aiming at technology.
For despite the Pandemic Crisis that erupted in 2019 in China, Technology has always found a path in contributing to the development of our youth and communities.

Our areas of motivation rallies through the following;
#### 1. Repair Cafe ####
#### 2. Podcasting ####
#### 3. Build Solar Charger ####
#### 4. Software Programing ####
#### 5. Data and Documentation ####

Despite the fact that we hope to reach many more resilient youth, there are some areas that we don't hope to participate in or even publish in any of our releases.
## WE DON'T PUBLISH

1. Anything that’s been covered on personal interest.
2. Anything that’s not related to tech / gadgets / innovation.
3. Anything that targets niches like gambling, pharma or erotica.
4. Anything that’s offensive or racially inclined.
