# Self-Motive4Tech
Self-motivation is the force that keeps pushing us to go on â€“ it's our internal drive to achieve, produce, develop, and keep moving forward. When you think you're ready to quit something, or you just don't know how to start, your self-motivation is what pushes you to go on. This repository project will let you identify yourself, and guide you through.
