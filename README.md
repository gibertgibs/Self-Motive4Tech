# Self-Motive4Tech
**Self-Motive4Tech** is a project intended to lay down a guide that serves to motivate any person, community or even an organisation with a goal aiming at technology.
For despite the Pandemic Crisis that erupted in 2019 in China, Technology has always found a path in contributing to the development of our youth and communities.

Self-motivation is the force that keeps pushing us to go on â€“ it's our internal drive to achieve, produce, develop, and keep moving forward. When you think you're ready to quit something, or you just don't know how to start, your self-motivation is what pushes you to go on. This repository project will let you identify yourself, and guide you through.
