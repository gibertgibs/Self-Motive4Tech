# CONTRIBUTION TO THE PROJECT CARRIES ACROSS THIS;

There’s no denying that what we are living through is new, difficult uncharted territory. With the COVID-19 crisis, we have all been forced to rethink and renew our ways of living, interacting and working. While the world may be in shock, society is proving its resilience and solidarity in overcoming the challenges that have arisen from this situation. Tech leaders, corporates and startups have reacted quickly by mobilizing their teams, resources and their innovative skills to fight this health crisis and its economic impact. We’re proud to see the tech world rallying to help.

## REPAIR CAFE AND IT'S MOTIVATION.

If you’ve ever found yourself on the phone or at the market side with a customer service representative telling you it would cost more to fix your electric appliance e.g. a phone than to just buy a new one, you are well acquainted with the concept of “planned obsolescence“. The good news is that people across the world are getting wise to the intentional design flaws hoisted upon us by clever manufacturers eager to sell more products, and are coming up with new and creative ways to salvage perfectly usable things.

If you are ready to launch a Repair Café in your community? Repair Café Palo Alto co-founder Peter Skinner shared some useful things to know before getting started…( Extracted from Useful Source)

1. **Getting the starter kit**

To keep with the Repair Café Foundation’s vision to jointly build up a network of active Repair Cafés with all the information easily accessible in one place, the first step before getting started is to request an information package from the Repair Café site.

Once you’ve introduced yourself to the fine folks at the Repair Café mothership and familiarized yourself with their basic guidelines, it’s time to test the waters in your own backyard.

2. **Finding a space.**

If you happen to own or have access to a place with tons of tools in it, good for you, you’re ready to go. If this dream space doesn’t (yet) exist, start as a small neighborhood event, perhaps in a driveway or a friend’s garage, then grow organically from there.

Another good way to get started is to ask local non-profits, your city, schools, or churches if they have a space they could make available for an afternoon. You can also tap local businesses that make space available on weekends and get their employees involved all at once. Bonus points if you can make friends with the folks at your local hardware store (wink wink, they’ve got tools).

Repair Café Palo Alto scored big when their local museum not only provided the hosting venue, but staff and board members thought it was such a great idea that they helped launch the event.

3. **Locating your fixers and equipment.**

It’s impossible to repair toys, printers, or hair driers without the people who know how to do it. It’s also challenging to do so without some vital pieces, like tables, power, and tools.

Usually one will lead to the other. If you can hook up with the fixers in your community, chances are they will have some of the tools needed and/or point you in the right direction to locate them. Inviting everyone to a potluck to brainstorm not only helps to figure out logistics but builds the camaraderie that defines the Repair Café spirit.

Peter Skinner feels lucky that his group scored on both ends — he was able to pull together a bunch of like-minded friends with repair skills, then found the perfect ally for the occasion: their local Ace Hardware store offered not only supplies, but an awesome staff enthusiastic about making the kick-off event a big success.

4. **Preparing for the event**

Now that you have enough skilled repair volunteers, pick a date (weekends are best) and start planning your first event.

Food provides not only the necessary energy for hard-working handy people and absorbent guests but it’s the glue that binds the community together. Make sure you have tasty donated treats lined up from local businesses or potluck items from your core volunteers.

You’ll also need to recruit volunteer organizers who will pick up donated food, manage the queue (if there is a wait list), sign in people, set up tables, and be there to deal with logistics and spread good repair vibes on the day of the event.

Depending on how large a space you have and how big of an event you are comfortable with, getting the word out can range from emails to your personal networks to contacting listservs, city services, or even your local newspaper or TV station. In Repair Café Palo Alto’s case, they had planned a soft launch without PR or major press, but local media got wind of the event and started tooting its horn, which Peter Skinner says made planning a bit more unpredictable. “It doesn’t hurt to plan for larger scale,” he advises. Generally speaking, the ratio that’s turned out to work best for them is 30 volunteers for every 100 visitors, with two thirds of volunteers fixers and one third organizers.

Make sure you publicize the kind of repairs you’re prepared for. For example, if you have seamstresses with sewing machines, you can give the green light to visitors with clothes in need of stitching. Likewise, it’s good to ask people not to bring products with a low fix rate, like microwaves or CD & DVD players. The more chunks that get repaired successfully, the better your repair crew and visitors alike will feel at the end of the day.

5. **Enjoy repair café day.**

So you’ve done all you could to get your space, people, and tools lined up and the big day has arrived. Time to relax and just take it all in… just kidding. Or not.

From active participants eager to learn how to fix their own things all the way to folks who just want to get their toaster toasting again, expect to accommodate a whole spectrum of people. From blenders and jewelry to chairs, luggage and bicycles, there will be a plethora of items, and more importantly, a whole bunch of neighbors to meet and stories to share. Think about it — repairing a meaningful object not only keeps the valuable materials it’s made from out of landfill and prevents the purchase of another shiny new (and poorly designed) gadget, but it adds another chapter to an already illustrious history we have with our most cherished belongings.

One of the essential elements of a Repair Cafe is that people don’t just come to drop off broken items to be picked up later like a traditional repair shop, but that everyone is matched up with a repair person to interact, learn, and build a relationship with the processes and materials that go into making our modern day conveniences possible. While some people maintain Repair Cafés are all about teaching people to fix their own stuff, Peter Skinner says his crew has decided to welcome everybody, even if they’re just coming to get their lamps fixed. “When people sit side by side with a repair person they’re participating just by being there,” Skinner says. “We really want to leverage that part, just to educate people to think about repair first.”

#### BUILDING A SOLAR CHARGER
**Note:** These carries along for students, communities or even a particular group.

**Note:** These guidelines are the copy cuts from Debutsh Schonder.

Each group needs:

2 mini solar panels
4 AA NiMH rechargeable batteries
2 2xAA battery holders
1 Schottky diode (1N5817)
1 USB connector (female)
case, such as a pencil case or small box
wire
paper and pencils
(optional, to charge Apple devices) a fairly simple voltage divider circuit to add to the circuit; see https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/voltage-dividers

For the class or group to share:

1. wire strippers
2. needle nose pliers
3. multimeter
4. USB test wire
5. soldering iron and solder
6. electrical tape
7. Procedure

Overview

Students undertake an engineering challenge to design and build solar USB chargers using solar panels, rechargeable batteries, and other components.

Procedure

In the form of a group/Community discussion, lead students through the following introductory questions:

Q1: What is the voltage of a NiMH AA battery? What is the voltage of four AA batteries connected in parallel? What is the voltage of four AA batteries connected in series? (Answer: Voltage of one NiMH AA battery is about 1.2 V. Four batteries in parallel: 0.3V. Four batteries in series: 4.8 V.)

Q2: What is the output voltage of the solar panel? What is the output voltage of two panels connected in parallel? What is the output voltage of two panels connected in series? (Answer: The answer depends on the solar panels chosen for the activity [for example, SparkFun sells solar panels that have a peak power output of 6 V]. For solar panels that have individual outputs of about 0.55 V [indoor lighting], two panels connected in parallel: 0.54 V. Two panels connected in series: 1.09 V. Their output mirrors the behavior of batteries in series/parallel.)

Q3: What do the solar panels do? Where do you think they should be placed in the circuit? (Answer: Solar panels convert light energy to electrical energy; they act like batteries and produce a voltage output. In this circuit, the solar panels provide power to recharge the batteries. Place the positive output of solar panel to the positive output of the battery pack.)

Q4: Why do you think that batteries are used? Where do you think they should be placed in the circuit? (Answer: The batteries store power from the solar panels so that you can charge your device when the sun is not out. Place them positive to positive, and negative to negative with the solar panels.)

Q5: What does the diode do? Where do you think it should be placed in the circuit? (Answer: The diode ensures that the current only runs one way. Place it between the positive terminal of the solar panel and the positive terminal of the battery, in such a way that the current flows only from the solar panels to the battery. This prevents the battery from discharging through the solar panel at night.)

Q6: At what voltage does a USB supply operate? (Answer: 5V)

Q7: Given our discussion, sketch a diagram that shows how you think the components should be arranged.

A circuit diagram shows the arrangement of a solar panel, diode, battery and USB supply.
Distribute materials and direct students to build and test according to steps 3-11.
Connect the battery holders and measure the voltage. Once students have determined the correct way to connect the batteries, have them connect the leads (wires) of the battery holders appropriately. (To connect them in series, connect the red wire of one holder to the black wire of another. To connect the leads in parallel, connect the two red wires together and the two black wires together.) Connect the wires together by twisting the ends of the leads (which have been previously stripped of insulation) and twisting, as shown in Figure 1. The wrapping pattern is designed to cause the termination to tighten as the conductors pull against each other.
A line drawing diagram shows how to make a short Western Union wire splice (the steps are drawings A through D), and two images of longer variations on the splice (drawings E and F). The basic steps are to twist two ends of a wire together counterclockwise 3/4 of a turn each, finger tight. Then, use needle-nose pliers to twist each end at least five more turns tightly around the other wire. Then finish off by pushing the cut-off ends close to the center wire they are wrapped around.
Connect the wires together by twisting them.
Install the AA batteries into the holders. To measure the battery voltage, have students use a multimeter and connect the black lead to the COM terminal and the red lead to the terminal with V listed next to it. Then set the multimeter to read DC voltage. Provide assistance to anyone who is unfamiliar with setting-up a multimeter.

Multimeter setup.

Have members touch the black probe to the stripped end of the black wire from the battery holders, and the red probe to the stripped end of the red wire from the battery holders. Tell students to record the voltage and compare it to the answer from introductory question 1. If a major discrepancy exists, encourage students to find the source of error, correct it, and repeat the measurement.

Connect the solar panels and measure the open circuit voltage. Once students have determined the correct way to connect the solar panels, have them repeat the above procedure for connecting and testing the voltage of the solar panels. Have students compare the measured voltage to the answer from Introductory Question 2. If a major discrepancy exists, tell students to find the source of error, correct it, and repeat the measurement.
Connect the diode. Diodes have polarity, so make sure students identify the positive and negative leads of the diode according to Figure 3. Have students connect the positive side of the diode to the positive wire from the solar panels by twisting the leads together. (Note: If students are putting the solar panel on top of a case, direct them to thread the solar panel wires through the case before making any connections.) Later, once the charger is tested, these connections will be soldered, but they must have a good mechanical connection to work for the test.
Identifying the anode and cathode of a diode.
Connect the battery holder. Have students connect the positive wire of the battery holders to the negative lead of the diode, and the negative wire of the battery connector to the negative wire from the solar panel using the same twisting wires method from the previous step.
Connect the USB port. Have students connect the positive (red) wire of the USB port to the junction containing the positive wire of the battery holder, and the negative wire of the boost connector to the junction containing the negative wire of the battery holder by twisting the wires together as shown in Figure 4. Make sure that students twist the wires firmly together so that they do not come apart while testing.
A line drawing diagram shows the connection of the red wire of the USB port to the junction containing the positive wire of the battery holder and the negative wire of the boost connector to the junction containing the negative wire of the battery holder. Identified are the “branch wire” and the “main wire.”
Connecting the main wire and the branch wire.
Test your system. Now, have students plug in the USB test wire into the USB port. Using the same multimeter setup as steps 3 and 4, tell students to measure the voltage across the USB test wire leads and record this voltage. (Expect the voltage to be ~5V; if not, look for a faulty component or faulty assembly.)
(optional) Install a voltage divider circuit to enable charging of Apple devices. If students want their USB chargers to work for Apple devices, a fairly simple voltage divider circuit needs to be added. See a tutorial on voltage dividers at https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/voltage-dividers. Have students read through this tutorial and design a voltage divider for their solar charger circuits.
Solder and insulate connections. Once the charger has been tested, tell students that the connections need to be made permanent by soldering. Solder the connections together for them. (See the Other section for recommended soldering tutorials.) Then, have students wrap electrical tape around the connections to insulate them.
Assemble completed circuit into case. Have students assemble their components into their cases, as desired. Look over their work and make sure that all connections are correctly insulated.
