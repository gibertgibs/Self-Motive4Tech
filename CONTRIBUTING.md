# CONTRIBUTION TO THE PROJECT CARRIES ACROSS THIS;

There’s no denying that what we are living through is new, difficult uncharted territory. With the COVID-19 crisis, we have all been forced to rethink and renew our ways of living, interacting and working. While the world may be in shock, society is proving its resilience and solidarity in overcoming the challenges that have arisen from this situation. Tech leaders, corporates and startups have reacted quickly by mobilizing their teams, resources and their innovative skills to fight this health crisis and its economic impact. We’re proud to see the tech world rallying to help.
