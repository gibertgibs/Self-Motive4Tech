## Welcome to the Self-Motive4Tech Homepage!
Self-Motive4Tech is a project intended to lay down a guide that serves to motivate any person, community or even organisations in the channel/run for technological development in the second and third world class.
Despite the Pandemic Crisis that erupted in 2019 in China, Technology has always found a path in contributing to the development of our youth and communities.

## SELF MOTIVATION
Self-motivation is the force that keeps pushing us to go on â€“ it's our internal drive to achieve, produce, develop, and keep moving forward. When you think you're ready to quit something, or you just don't know how to start, your self-motivation is what pushes you to go on. This repository project will let you identify yourself, and guide you through.
